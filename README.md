# IEA Wind Task32 Collaborative R&D Roadmap
IEA Wind Task 32 coordinates a range of research and development activities for wind lidar for wind energy applications. In order to help Task members and others keep an overview of what's happening in the Task, we have created a visual road map showing these activities.

To find out more about specific activities, see the Task 32 website at https://community.ieawind.org/task32/home.

This repository includes:
 - A PDF of the roadmap: "IEA_Wind_Task_32__Collaborative_RD_Roadmap.pdf".
 - A banner image for visualisation
 - All of the files required to produce the roadmap using the LaTeX document preparation system.

Please note that this document will be updated regularly. Please check for the most up-to-date versions at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3374354.
