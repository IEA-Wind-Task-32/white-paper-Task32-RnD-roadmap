# IEA Wind Task32 Collaborative R&D Roadmap
IEA Wind Task 32 coordinates a range of research and development activities for wind lidar for wind energy applications. In order to help Task members and others keep an overview of what's happening in the Task, we have created this  roadmap.

Some groups would call this document a _strategy_, but our activities change in response to our members' needs and resources. As a result this document serves more to keep everyone up-to-date with what's going on and where we are all headed; hence, 'roadmap'.

## Activities
To find out more about Task 32 activities, see the Task 32 website at https://community.ieawind.org/task32/home.

# Versions
This document will be updated regularly.

## Getting the most up-to-date version
